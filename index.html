Create a fully functional, responsive single-page web application called "Thinknex" that provides a suite of 27 free online PDF tools for managing, editing, and converting PDF files directly in the browser. The website should be secure, user-friendly, and process files client-side without server uploads. Below are the detailed requirements:
General Requirements
Purpose: Offer a comprehensive set of PDF tools (e.g., merge, split, compress, convert, edit, sign, watermark) that are free, accessible online, and require no software installation.
Technology Stack:
HTML5 for structure.
CSS3 for styling with a modern, clean design.
JavaScript (ES6+) for interactivity and core tool logic.
External libraries:
pdf-lib.js (v1.17.1) for PDF manipulation.
pdf.js (v2.16.105) for PDF rendering.
tesseract.js (v5) for OCR (optional, if implemented).

CSS Requirements
Design System:
Use CSS custom properties (e.g., --primary-red: #e5322d, --background-light: #f8f8fa) for consistent theming.
Font: System stack (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif).
Colors: Red (#e5322d) for primary actions, neutral grays for text/backgrounds.
Layout:
Container: Max-width 1200px, centered with padding.
Tools grid: Responsive, auto-fill columns (min 250px on desktop, 200px on tablet, 1fr on mobile).
Modal: Fixed, full-screen overlay with centered content, max-width 800px, scrollable body.
Animations:
Smooth scroll behavior (scroll-behavior: smooth).
Fade-in and slide-up reveal animations for sections and tool cards using IntersectionObserver.
Hover effects on tool cards (scale up, shadow, border color change).
Modal fade-in animation (@keyframes fadeIn).
Loading spinner animation (@keyframes spin).
Responsive Design:
Mobile (max-width: 768px):
Hide desktop navigation, show hamburger menu.
Collapse tools grid to smaller cards or single column.
Hide sidebar ad in modal.
Small screens (max-width: 480px):
Further reduce font sizes and padding.
Tools grid becomes single-column.
Accessibility:
Semantic HTML (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>).
Keyboard-navigable menu and modal controls.
High-contrast colors for readability.
JavaScript Requirements
Initialization:
Run all logic after DOM content is loaded (DOMContentLoaded event).
Configure pdf.js worker source for PDF rendering.
UI Interactions:
Header: Add shadow on scroll (scrolled class when scrollY > 50).
Hamburger Menu: Toggle mobile navigation and animate hamburger icon to "X" on click.
Reveal Animations: Use IntersectionObserver to add active class to elements when 10% visible.
Tool Cards: Dynamically generate cards from a toolImplementations object, each with click event to open modal.
Modal:
Open on tool card click, close via close button or overlay click.
Drag-and-drop file upload with visual feedback (dragover class).
File list updates dynamically with remove buttons.
Process button disabled until files are selected.
Show/hide loader with customizable text during processing.
Tool Logic (toolImplementations Object):
Each tool has properties: title, desc, icon, fileType, multiple (boolean), options (function for UI), process (async function for processing), onFileSelect (optional, for UI setup).
Example tools (implement all 27, with at least the following in detail):
Merge PDF:
Accept multiple PDFs, combine into one using PDFDocument.create() and copyPages.
Output: Single merged.pdf.
Split PDF:
Accept one PDF, allow page range input (e.g., "1-3, 5, 7-9").
Extract specified pages into a new PDF.
Output: split.pdf.
Compress PDF:
Accept one PDF, offer quality slider (0.1–1.0).
Re-encode images with JPEG compression at selected quality.
Output: compressed.pdf.
PDF to Word:
Extract text from PDF using pdf.js, output as .txt (note: formatting not preserved).
PDF to PowerPoint:
Convert each PDF page to a PNG slide in a PPTX file using pptxgenjs.
Output: converted.pptx.
Word to PDF:
Convert DOCX to HTML using mammoth, then to PDF using html2pdf.
Output: word.pdf (auto-download).
Edit PDF:
Use fabric.js for canvas-based editing (add text, rectangles, free drawing).
Support multi-page navigation with prev/next buttons.
Save edits as JSON per page, apply to PDF using PDFDocument.
Output: edited.pdf.
Sign PDF:
Provide a fabric.js canvas for drawing a signature.
Embed signature as PNG on the first page.
Output: signed.pdf.
Watermark PDF:
Accept text input and opacity slider (0.1–1.0).
Add diagonal watermark to all pages using PDFDocument.drawText.
Output: watermarked.pdf.
Rotate PDF:
Offer rotation options (90°, 180°, 270° clockwise).
Apply rotation to all pages using PDFDocument.setRotation.
Output: rotated.pdf.
Other tools (e.g., PDF to JPG, JPG to PDF, etc.) follow similar patterns, using appropriate libraries for conversions or manipulations.
Utilities:
showLoader(text): Display loader with custom text.
hideLoader(): Hide loader.
showError(message): Show alert with error message.
createDownloadLink(data, filename, type): Generate download link for processed files.
resetModal(): Clear modal state (files, options, output, canvas).
updateFileList(): Refresh file list UI with remove buttons.
handleFiles(files): Process dropped/selected files based on tool settings.
renderPdfPageToCanvas(pdfDoc, pageNum, canvas): Render PDF page to canvas for previews or conversions.
Error Handling:
Validate file types and quantities per tool.
Catch and display errors during processing (e.g., invalid page ranges, unsupported file formats).
Log errors to console for debugging.
Additional Notes
Security: Emphasize client-side processing in UI (e.g., footer text: "Process files directly in your browser without uploading anything").
Performance: Optimize for large PDFs by processing pages incrementally and showing progress (e.g., "Processing page X/Y").
Extensibility: Structure toolImplementations to easily add new tools.
Placeholder Content:
Ad placeholders should display "Advertisement" text with dashed borders.
Commented-out Google Analytics code for easy setup.
Output Files: Name outputs descriptively (e.g., merged.pdf, compressed.pdf) and use appropriate MIME types.
Deliverables
A single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.
Fully functional code for at least the specified tools, with placeholders or basic implementations for the remaining tools.
Responsive, polished UI matching the described design system.
Clear documentation (in code comments) for setup and customization (e.g., adding analytics, ad code).
